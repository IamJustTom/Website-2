        <h1>Site Report</h1>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have managed to learn the basics of HTML quite quickly with the basic structure including head, body, and etc. It wasn't that complicated overall but at the beginning structuring it was a bit tough. Luckily, I have been taught the basic grid method to use which has helped me establish a basic structure.</li>
        <li>I have also managed the basics of linking different HTML files together with the linking method and referencing it so when clicked it would take them to that specific page.</li>
        <li>The click mechanic was quite tough to understand as it does also combine the use of CSS. However, in HTML alone, linking them back and forth was complicated to understand but managed to use it effectively and make it so it's able to function smoothly on the mobile version while leaving the "Other Pages" open to see throughout the person's experience on desktop.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I have found CSS to be quite hard to understand. I believe I'm pretty bad with the general aesthetic building and still quite unsure how to use all the tools together to improve the site further and further. Currently, the design is quite boring and not interactive at all which could easily be improved by others but I have struggled to find myself doing anything as I'm still quite scared of going too far into it and having too many problems.</li>
        <li>I have managed to get the general aesthetic for the "Hamburger" Icon to function without any further help than what was provided in lectures which I'm quite happy with, even implementing the fact that the menu will start closed until opened via usage of the icon.</li>
        <li>I have made 3 CSS files altogether for the different parts with one of them being the main file with the basic concept and the mobile and desktop with their own separate function. In the future, I do plan to go further into it and put more unique details on how it should function rather than just having the site go from being a grid to just up and down list of things.</li>
    </ul>
